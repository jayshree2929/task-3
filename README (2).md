# SQL Internship - Task 3

## ðŸ“Œ Topic: Writing Basic SELECT Queries

This task focuses on retrieving data using SQL `SELECT` statements. The queries were executed on the `LibraryDB` schema built in Task 1 and populated in Task 2.

## âœ… What I Did

In this task, I practiced a variety of SQL commands to extract and filter information from a relational database. I used the `SELECT` statement with different clauses to achieve the following:

1. Display all data from tables.
2. Retrieve only specific columns.
3. Filter rows based on conditions using `WHERE`, `AND`, `OR`.
4. Use `LIKE` to match text patterns.
5. Use `BETWEEN` to filter values within a range.
6. Sort the data using `ORDER BY` in ascending and descending order.
7. Limit the number of rows returned using `LIMIT`.
8. Handle NULL values using `IS NULL`.
9. Rename columns with `AS` for aliasing.
10. Use `DISTINCT` to remove duplicate values.

| Command                | Purpose                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `SELECT * FROM table;` | Show all data from a table              |

| `WHERE`                | Filter rows                             |
| `AND`, `OR`            | Combine multiple filters                |
| `LIKE '%value%'`       | Match patterns in text                  |
| `BETWEEN val1 AND val2`| Filter values in a range                |
| `ORDER BY`             | Sort rows                               |
| `LIMIT n`              | Limit the number of output rows         |
| `IS NULL`              | Identify missing data                   |
| `AS`                   | Alias columns                           |
| `DISTINCT`             | Return unique values only               |
